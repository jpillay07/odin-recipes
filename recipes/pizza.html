    <h2>Margetita Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        For the best margherita pizza, you will want to preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible. For my oven, that is 550 degrees Fahrenheit. I allow my baking steel to preheat for at least 30 minutes (regardless of whether my oven is ready as it takes time for your baking stone to come to temperature). The higher the temperature the better.
    </p>

    <p>This recipe makes two 10-inch pizzas, and they should be able to properly cook in 7 to 8 minutes at that temperature.</p>
